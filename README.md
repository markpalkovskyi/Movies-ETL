# Movies-ETL
1.Project Overview
    In this module we had to create huge transformations and data loads into an existing PostgreSQL database from Wikipedia data, MovieLens rating data and Kaggle Data.
    For this analysis we made 4 deliverable breakdowns
    1)Write an ETL function to read 3 data files
    2)transform wikipedia data
    3)transform Kaggle/ratings data
    4)Create a new database for movie using a PostgreSQL

2.Result
    To create a 3 separate DataFrames we used the wiki json, kaggle metadata and moviele s csv file.
    In the deliverable 1 we've got a 193 Columns (wiki movies json file)
    in the Deliverable 2 we've got a 23 columns (Kaggle movie)
    in the deliverable 3 we've got a 21 columns (clean wiki file)

3. Summary
    the purpose of this project was to combine 3 files into 1 database by extracting, transfoeming and joining the files. Then we used the haclathon participants analysis...
